summary: ''
abstract: 'Over the past decade, the soaring growth of renewable generation like
wind and solar, and of distributed energy resources such as electric vehicles and
rooftop solar generation, have triggered a paradigm shift in the operations of
power grids. The resulting increase in operational uncertainty, both on the
demand and the supply side, calls for new operational practices that explicitly
quantify and manage risk. In this talk, I will present a new generation of tools that
address this challenge, via a combination of optimization and machine-learning
techniques, namely, probabilistic forecasting, optimization under uncertainty,
principled risk assesment, and machine learning-based acceleration techniques.
The presentation will focus on stochastic optimization, and ML-based
optimization proxies for fast risk assessment. Computational results will be
reported on a real industrial system.'
