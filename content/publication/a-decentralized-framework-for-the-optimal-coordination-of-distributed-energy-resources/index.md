abstract: Demand-response aggregators are faced with the challenge of how to
  best manage numerous and heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs).
  This paper proposes a decentralized methodology for optimal coordination of
  DERs. The proposed approach is based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and column
  generation, thus allowing to integrate any type of resource whose operation
  can be formulated within a mixed-integer linear program. We show that the
  proposed framework offers the same guarantees of optimality as a centralized
  formulation, with the added benefits of distributed computation, enhanced
  privacy, and higher robustness to changes in the problem data. The practical
  efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated through extensive computational
  experiments, on a set of instances generated using data from Ontario energy
  markets. The proposed approach was able to solve all test instances to proven
  optimality, while achieving significant speed-ups over a centralized
  formulation solved by state-of-the-art optimization software.
