abstract: This paper studies disjunctive cutting planes in Mixed-Integer Conic
  Programming. Building on conic duality, we formulate a cut-generating conic
  program for separating disjunctive cuts, and investigate the impact of the
  normalization condition on its resolution. In particular, we show that a
  careful selection of normalization guarantees its solvability and conic strong
  duality. Then, we highlight the shortcomings of separating conic-infeasible
  points in an outer-approximation context, and propose conic extensions to the
  classical lifting and monoidal strengthening procedures. Finally, we assess
  the computational behavior of various normalization conditions in terms of gap
  closed, computing time and cut sparsity. In the process, we show that our
  approach is competitive with the internal lift-and-project cuts of a
  state-of-the-art solver.
