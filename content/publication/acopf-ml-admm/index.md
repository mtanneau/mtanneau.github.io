abstract: One potential future for the next generation of smart grids is the use
  of decentralized optimization algorithms and secured communications for
  coordinating renewable generation (e.g., wind/solar), dispatchable devices
  (e.g., coal/gas/nuclear generations), demand response, battery & storage
  facilities, and topology optimization. The Alternating Direction Method of
  Multipliers (ADMM) has been widely used in the community to address such
  decentralized optimization problems and, in particular, the AC Optimal Power
  Flow (AC-OPF). This paper studies how machine learning may help in speeding up
  the convergence of ADMM for solving AC-OPF. It proposes a novel decentralized
  machine-learning approach, namely ML-ADMM, where each agent uses deep learning
  to learn the consensus parameters on the coupling branches. The paper also
  explores the idea of learning only from ADMM runs that exhibit high-quality
  convergence properties, and proposes filtering mechanisms to select these
  runs. Experimental results on test cases based on the French system
  demonstrate the potential of the approach in speeding up the convergence of
  ADMM significantly.
