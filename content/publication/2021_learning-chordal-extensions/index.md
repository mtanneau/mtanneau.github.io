abstract: "A highly influential ingredient of many techniques designed to
  exploit sparsity in numerical optimization is the so-called chordal extension
  of a graph representation of the optimization problem. The definitive relation
  between chordal extension and the performance of the optimization algorithm
  that uses the extension is not a mathematically understood task. For this
  reason, we follow the current research trend of looking at Combinatorial
  Optimization tasks by using a Machine Learning lens, and we devise a framework
  for learning elimination rules yielding high-quality chordal extensions. As a
  first building block of the learning framework, we propose an imitation
  learning scheme that mimics the elimination ordering provided by an expert
  rule. Results show that our imitation learning approach is effective in
  learning two classical elimination rules: the minimum degree and minimum
  fill-in heuristics, using simple Graph Neural Network models with only a
  handful of parameters. Moreover, the learned policies display remarkable
  generalization performance, across both graphs of larger size, and graphs from
  a different distribution."
