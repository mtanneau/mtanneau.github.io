abstract: This paper proposes a novel and simple linear model to capture line
  losses for use in linearized DC models, such as optimal power flow (DC-OPF)
  and security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED). The Line Loss Outer
  Approximation (LLOA) model implements an outer approximation of the line
  losses lazily and typically terminates in a small number of iterations.
  Experiments on large-scale power systems demonstrate the accuracy and
  computational efficiency of LLOA and contrast it with classical line loss
  approaches. The results seem to indicate that LLOA is a practical and useful
  model for real-world applications, providing a good tradeoff between accuracy,
  computational efficiency, and implementation simplicity. In particular, the
  LLOA method may have significant advantages compared to the traditional loss
  factor formulation for multi-period, stochastic optimization problems where
  good reference points may not be available. The paper also provides a
  comprehensive overview and evaluation of approximation methods for line
  losses.
