abstract: A critical aspect of power systems research is the availability of
  suitable data, access to which is limited by privacy concerns and the
  sensitive nature of energy infrastructure. This lack of data, in turn, hinders
  the development of modern research avenues such as machine learning approaches
  or stochastic formulations. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a
  systematic, data-driven framework for reconstructing high-fidelity time
  series, using publicly-available grid snapshots and historical data published
  by transmission system operators. The proposed approach, from geo-spatial data
  and generation capacity reconstruction, to time series disaggregation, is
  applied to the French transmission grid. Thereby, synthetic but highly
  realistic time series data, spanning multiple years with a 5-minute
  granularity, is generated at the individual component level.
