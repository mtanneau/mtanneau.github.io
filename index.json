The computational requirements of the forward uncertainty propagation problem, which must solve numerous security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) optimizations, is a major barrier for such real-time risk assessment. This paper proposes a Just-In-Time Risk Assessment Learning Framework (JITRALF) as an alternative. JITRALF trains risk surrogates, one for each hour in the day, using Machine Learning (ML) to predict the quantities needed to estimate risk, without explicitly solving the SCED problem. This significantly reduces the computational burden of the forward uncertainty propagation and allows for fast, real-time risk estimation. The paper also proposes a novel, asymmetric loss function and shows that models trained using the asymmetric loss perform better than those using symmetric loss functions. JITRALF is evaluated on the French transmission system for assessing the risk of insufficient operating reserves, the risk of load shedding, and the expected operating cost.","tags":null,"title":"Just-In-Time Learning for Operational Risk Assessment in Power Grids","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Klamkin","Mathieu Tanneau","Terrence W.

In a context of growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable generators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously monitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system’s behavior under various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately, systematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not practical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e., a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in milliseconds. Motivated by a principled analysis of the market-clearing optimizations of MISO, the paper proposes a novel just-in-time ML pipeline that addresses the main challenges of learning SCED solutions, i.e., the variability in load, renewable output and production costs, as well as the combinatorial structure of commitment decisions. A novel combined classification-plus-regression architecture is also proposed, to further capture the behavior of SCED solutions. Numerical experiments are reported on the French transmission system, and demonstrate the approach’s ability to produce, within a time frame that is compatible with real-time operations, accurate optimization proxies that produce relative errors below 1%.","tags":[],"title":"Learning Optimization Proxies for Large-Scale Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoruo Zhao","Mathieu Tanneau","Pascal Van Hentenryck"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656779384,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656779384,"objectID":"11dc4758799f3c342b9874a999a08730","permalink":"https://mtanneau.github.io/publication/lloa/","publishdate":"2022-07-02T16:29:44.264Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lloa/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a novel and simple linear model to capture line losses for use in linearized DC models, such as optimal power flow (DC-OPF) and security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED).

In particular, this allows to seamlessly integrate specialized routines for structured problems. Extensive computational results are reported. We find that Tulip is competitive with open-source interior-point solvers on the H. Mittelmann’s benchmark of barrier linear programming solvers. Furthermore, we design specialized linear algebra routines for structured master problems in the context of Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition.

For this reason, we follow the current research trend of looking at Combinatorial Optimization tasks by using a Machine Learning lens, and we devise a framework for learning elimination rules yielding high-quality chordal extensions. As a first building block of the learning framework, we propose an imitation learning scheme that mimics the elimination ordering provided by an expert rule. Results show that our imitation learning approach is effective in learning two classical elimination rules: the minimum degree and minimum fill-in heuristics, using simple Graph Neural Network models with only a handful of parameters.

These developments have been met by a likewise increase in the size and complexity of the models that practitioners aim to solve: there is no shortage of challenging problems. In that context, this thesis investigates the use of structure-exploiting techniques within generic optimization paradigms, to tackle large-scale or otherwise intractable instances. In particular, we build on the observation that structure-exploiting techniques can often be viewed as specialized implementations of one or several individual components of generic MIP algorithms. First, we consider the coordination of Distributed Energy Resources in power systems. This problem is first formulated as a centralized –but intractable– mixed-integer linear program, then reformulated using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and solved by a column-generation algorithm. The proposed framework is generic, i.e., it can handle resources of arbitrary nature, and computationally efficient: problems with thousands or resources are solved to proven optimality in less than an hour. Finally, besides scalability, the decomposition scheme naturally addresses some privacy concerns regarding the operation of individual resources. Second, we focus on structure-exploiting interior-point methods for linear programming. To that end, we develop an open-source interior-point solver, Tulip, whose algorithmic framework is disentangled from linear algebra implementations. This flexible design allows to easily integrate specialized, user-provided linear algebra routines. Through various numerical experiments, we demonstrate the flexibility, efficiency and robustness of the code. Finally, we investigate the separation of disjunctive cutting planes in mixed-integer conic programming, and demonstrate the benefits of exploiting a problem’s conic structure. Leveraging conic duality, the separation of disjunctive cuts is formulated in a single cut-generating conic problem (CGCP); this dual perspective offers a number of insights that were unavailable to previous approaches. In particular, we study the theoretical and computational merits of several normalization conditions, including the loss of strong conic duality in the separation problem, and the separation of conic-infeasible points in the context of outer-approximation algorithms. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach on several classes of instances.","tags":null,"title":"Exploiting Structure in Mixed-Integer Linear and Nonlinear Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Anjos","Andrea Lodi","Mathieu Tanneau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535474809,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535474809,"objectID":"028fc99bbd35725edbb6a2ab80185f67","permalink":"https://mtanneau.github.io/publication/der-dantzig-wolfe/","publishdate":"2018-08-28T16:46:49.099Z","relpermalink":"/publication/der-dantzig-wolfe/","section":"publication","summary":"Demand-response aggregators are faced with the challenge of how to best manage numerous and heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs).
