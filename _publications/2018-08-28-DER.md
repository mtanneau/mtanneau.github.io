**Abstract**
Demand-response aggregators are faced with the challenge of how to
best manage numerous and heterogeneous distributed energy resources (DERs).
This paper proposes a decentralized methodology for optimal coordination of
DERs. The proposed approach is based on Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and column
generation, thus allowing to integrate any type of resource whose operation
can be formulated within a mixed-integer linear program. We show that the
proposed framework offers the same guarantees of optimality as a centralized
formulation, with the added benefits of distributed computation, enhanced
privacy, and higher robustness to changes in the problem data. The practical
efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated through extensive computational
experiments, on a set of instances generated using data from Ontario energy
markets. The proposed approach was able to solve all test instances to proven
optimality, while achieving significant speed-ups over a centralized
formulation solved by state-of-the-art optimization software.
